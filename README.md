# ICSE-2027
This is data and code for ProbeFuse submited to ICSE-2027



## Instructions
This is the experimental process code and data of the proposed method ProbeFuse.

If you want to check the result obtained in the paper, we also provide the data, code, results, models and running log in total of 88GB zip file of our experiments, which is the same folder name in the Zenodo as this repository. 

If you need to repeat the performance values ​​of the experimental results and further design, we recommend running the code according to the next guidance.

## Preliminary Study
### Probe Datasets and Tasks
We employ the same experimental procedure as Karmakar et al. \cite{DBLP:conf/kbse/KarmakarR21}, using 1000 Java samples with a uniform class distribution, i.e., split ratio of 6:2:2, from the JEMMA dataset on the three tasks, i.e., Identifier Tagging (IDN), AST Node Tagging (AST), Cyclomatic Complexity (CPX) for probing code attribute information of code PTMs layer by layer. 
### Probe Code and Execute
First we will create and activate a virtual environment with anaconda, the Probe_GA.tar.gz is our environment, you could put it in your own computer. 
   ```   
   $ conda activate Probe_GA
   ```   
Then we begin probing the code pre-trained models layer by layer using probe datasets and tasks, and we will get the scores of each layer for three code attribute of code PTMs.
   ```   
   $ python probe_extractor.py & python probe_classifier-accuracy.py > results/results.txt
   ```   

### Sliding Window Strategy
We use a sliding window strategy to calculate the sum of the accuracy of consecutive layers of length 2, and return the result with the highest score, which means each module consists of two consecutive layers with the highest accuracy. Then, each code PTM is divided into three modules: the two consecutive layers with the richest lexical information constitute the lexical module, the two consecutive layers with the richest syntactic information constitute the syntactic module, and the two consecutive layers with the richest structural information constitute the structural module and semantic knowledge is implicitly preserved within all selected modules.

We input the results obtained above into the INPUT PROBE RESULTS section of the modular.py file, and executing the file will produce the Top-3 candidate modules selected according to a two-layer sliding strategy.
   ```   
   $ python modular.py
   ```   
Then we get 18 code functional modules, each code PTM have three code modules.

## Details
### Dataset Partition
code clone detection: Train-901028, Valid-415416, Test-415416

technical debt detection: Train-23012, Valid-7674, Test-7674




### Finetune 

For code clone detection, use 10% Train and 10% Valid for fine-tuning, for code smell detection and technical debt detection, use full Train and Valid for fine-tuning.

### Hyperparameters
The training and testing commands and hyperparameters can be found in the setcode files in each folder. Training hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and random seed are aligned with FMF and OSM in the same task and scenario to ensure fair and optimal comparisons.
